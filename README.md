# Pythonista High School Code

This is a small collection of the code I wrote in high school on my iPhone 4
for Pythonista. I'm archiving it here so I don't lose track of it, and
occasionally the lambda calculus reducer is useful for a demonstration.

Note: The lambda calculus reducer has been [rewritten in Haskell][lambd]

The code is released under the MIT license.
